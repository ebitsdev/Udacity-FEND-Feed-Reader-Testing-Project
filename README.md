Write a README file detailing all steps required to successfully run the application. If you have added additional tests (for Udacious Test Coverage), provide documentation for what these future features are and what the tests are checking for.

# Project Overview

We use Jasmine to create the following test suites against the feed reader application:
1. `allFeeds`
2. `The Menu`
3. `"Initial Entries"`
4. `"New Feed Selection"`
